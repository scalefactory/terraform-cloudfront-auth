# Short description of this project
description: |-
  A Terraform module to provision a Cloudfront distribution to serve private
  content in an S3 bucket with Lamba@Edge Google/Microsoft/Github/Okta/Auth0/Centrify
  authentication. Based on [Widen - Cloudfront Auth](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/)

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  You should use this module if you have a private S3 bucket that you want to
  guard with Google/Microsoft/Github/Okta/Auth0/Centrify authentication.

  The Terraform packages up
  [cloudfront-auth](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/) into a Lambda
  function to be used by Cloudfront's
  [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/). A private S3 bucket and
  Cloudfront Distribution will also be created.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  **NOTE**: You will need to create a certificate with AWS Certificate Manager in
  the `us-east-1` region. The example below assumes a certificate for the domain
  `example.com` already exists.

  ```hcl
  module "cloudfront_auth" {
    source                         = "git::https://github.com/scalefactory/terraform-cloudfront-auth.git?ref=master"

    auth_vendor                    = "github"
    cloudfront_distribution        = "private.example.com"
    client_id                      = "CHANGE_ME"
    client_secret                  = "CHANGE_ME"
    redirect_uri                   = "https://private.example.com/callback"
    github_organization            = "exampleorg"

    bucket_name                    = "private.example.com"
    region                         = "eu-west-1"
    cloudfront_acm_certificate_arn = "${data.aws_acm_certificate.example.arn}"
  }

  data "aws_acm_certificate" "example" {
    domain   = "example.com"
    statuses = ["ISSUED"]
  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  A Full working example can be found in [example](./example) folder. Please
  update the `cloudfront_auth` module parameters. **NOTE**: The certificate will
  need validating with email first.
